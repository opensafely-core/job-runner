    """
    API for managing job execution.

    This API is called by the job-runner to manage each job it is tracking. It models the running of a job as a state
    machine, and the methods below are the transitions between states.

    They should return either:
     - the next state if successful
     - the ERROR state with an appropriate message if something has gone wrong.
     - the current state if is different from the expected state, with a message
     - the initial state to indicate back pressure and to retry later.

    Given the long running nature of jobs, it is an asynchronous API, and calls should not block for a more than a few
    seconds.

    All the state transition methods (prepare(), execute(), finalize(), terminate(), cleanup()) must be idempotent. If
    the relevant task they are responsible for is already running for that job, they must not start a new task, and
    instead return successfully the current state. This is best acheived by a guard to check the job's state, and
    return its current state if in the state you would expect. It's the responsibility of the job-runner scheduler to
    figure out what to do in this case.

    """

    def prepare(self, job_definition: JobDefinition) -> JobStatus:

        Launch a prepare task for a job, transitioning to the initial PREPARING state.

        1. Validate the JobDefinition. If there are errors, return an ERROR state with message.

        2. Check the job is currently in UNKNOWN state. If not return its current state, and the job-runner will handle
           the unexpected transition.

        3. Check the resources are available to prepare the job. If not, return the UNKNOWN state with an appropriate
           message.

        4. Create an ephemeral workspace to use for executing this job. This is expected to be a volume mounted into the
           container, but other implementations are allowed.

        5. Launch a prepare task asynchronously. If launched successfully, return the PREPARING state. If not, return an
           ERROR state with message.

        The prepare task must do the following:

          - check out the supplied study repo via the OpenSAFELY github proxy into the ephemeral workspace, erroring if
            there are any failures.
          - copying the supplied file inputs from the long-term workspace storage into the ephemeral workspace, erroring
            if there are any missing.

        When the prepare task finishes, the get_status() call should now return PREPARED for this job.

        This method must be idempotent. If called with a job that is already running a prepare task, it must not
        launch a new task, and simply return successfully with PREPARING.

        Launch the execution of a job that has been prepared, transitioning from PREPARED to EXECUTING.

        1. Check the job is in the PREPARED state. If not, return its current state, and the job-runner will handle the
           unexpected transition.

        2. Validate that the ephemeral workspace created by prepare for this job exists.  If not, return an ERROR
           state with message.

           message.

        4. Launch the job execution task asynchronously. If launched successfully, return the EXECUTING state. If not,
           return an ERROR state with message.

        The execution task must do the following:

        The specified image must be run, with the provided arguments and environment variables. The implementation
        may add environment variables to those in the job definition as necessary for the backend.

        The job should be run without any network access, unless job_definition.allow_database_access is set to True,
        in which case it should be run with a network allowing access to the database and any configuration needed to
        contact and authenticate with the database should be provided as environment variables.

        The job must be run with the ephemeral workspace for this job at /workspace in the filesystem.

        When the execute task finishes, the get_status() call must now return EXECUTED for this job.

        launch a new task, and simply return successfully with EXECUTING.

           unexpected transition.

        2. Validate that the job's ephemeral workspace exists. If not, return an ERROR state with message.

        3. Launch the finalize task asynchronously. If launched successfully, return the FINALIZING state. If not,
           return an ERROR state with message.

        The finalize task should do the following:

        Any files that the job produced that match the output spec in the definition must be copied from the ephemeral
        workspace to the workspace long-term storage. Anything written by the container to stdout or stderr must be
        captured and written to a log file, metadata/{action}.log, in the workspace in long-term storage.

        The action log file and any files in the output spec marked as medium privacy must also be made available in the
        medium privacy view of the workspace in long-term storage.

        The action log file and any useful metadata from the job run should also be written to a separate log storage
        area in long-term storage.

        If the job has been cancelled, it should only preserve the action log file.

        When the finalize task finishes, the get_status() call should now return FINALIZED for this job, and
        get_results() call should return the JobResults for this job.

        2. Return EXECUTED state with a message.

        Terminating a running job is considered an expected state, not an error state. This decision
        also makes it easier for current executor implementations to cleanup after termination, and
        is consistent with the handling of programs that exit of their own accord with a return code.

        This method must be idempotent; it will be called at least once for every finished job. The implementation
        may defer resource cleanup to this method if necessary in order to correctly implement idempotency of
        get_status() or get_results(). If the job is unknown, it should still return UNKNOWN successfully.
