"""
Thin wrapper around `subprocess.run` which ensures that any arguments which are
pathlib instances get coerced to strings, which is necessary for them to work
on Windows (but not POSIX). Most of these issues are fixed in Python 3.8 so
it's possible we can drop this later. (The exception being the `env` argument
which the documentation doesn't mention so we'll have to wait and see.)
