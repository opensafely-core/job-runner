###################################
# These environment variables are used by both agent and CONTROLLER
# They may be different on agent/controller

# Comma separated list of known backends; default if unset: test,tpp,emis
# NOTE: If using a local job-server, BACKENDS must be a list of backends that are
# valid on the local job-server AND <BACKEND>_JOB_SERVER_TOKEN must be set
# for each of them.
# Here we're assuming we only have one backend, 'test'. Add more depending on your
# local job-server setup.
